    <p>PhD Candidate – Artificial Intelligence for SAR Imaging</p>
    <p style="max-width:600px;margin:20px auto 0 auto;font-size:1.1em;color:#444;">
      As an engineer with a degree from ISEN Lille, I am currently pursuing a PhD at Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and the CEA, specializing in artificial intelligence applied to radar imaging (SAR). My work focuses on the development of deep learning methods for the analysis and interpretation of radar images, particularly in InSAR, with applications in Earth observation and defense.
